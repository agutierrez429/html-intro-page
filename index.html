        <p>My name is Alexis and this is my first web design project. This is my 4th year at CSUDH and I'm a Computer Science major. I want to become a Software Engineer soon.</p>
        <h2>My Goals</h2>
        <p>My goals are to learn web development skills, build a portfolio of projects, and eventually work as a software engineer in a company that values innovation and collaboration. Hopefully I can find an internship for the summer. I enjoy working on and driving cars.</p>
